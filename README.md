# Opensearch-prototype
A basic prototype of an inverted index search engine to understand how OpenSearch works internally. It tokenizes words, builds an index, and supports search queries. While not as efficient as OpenSearch itself, I optimized it as much as possible for learning purposes. Handles large text files by splitting them into chunks. ðŸš€
